            "Hello, my name is Ahmed Mohamed Sayed. I graduated from Helwan University in 2023 with a degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.
            My graduation project was a Real Estate System using PHP and Laravel. 
            I enjoy backend development and working with databases. 
            I have good communication skills, I can solve problems efficiently, and I love learning new technologies.
            I also work well in a team and manage my time effectively.
            I am excited to join a professional environment where I can grow and contribute."
